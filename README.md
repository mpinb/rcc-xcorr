## Requirements
To accelerate correlations using GPU an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.2+ libraries installed. 

The **rcc-xcorr** has been tested with Python 3.8

Additional requirements:
* numpy
* scipy
* tqdm
* cupy (optional)
* [GPUtil](https://github.com/anderskm/gputil) (optional)
* [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html)
* perfplot (to run the benchmark scripts)
* tifffile (to run the test scripts)
* dill (to run the test scripts)
* matplotlib (to run the test scripts)

## Installation

Before installing `rcc-xcorr` please update `setuptools` and `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install -U setuptools pip
```

By default, the `rcc-xcorr` tool is installed without GPU support using:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/research-center-caesar/rcc-xcorr.git
```

In order to use the `rcc-xcorr` tool with GPU acceleration, the optional dependencies have to be installed too:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/research-center-caesar/rcc-xcorr.git#egg=rcc-xcorr[with-gpu]
```

***Note:***  Read this [post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/11/pip-install-from-a-git-repository/) to understand 
why ``python -m pip`` is preferred over just ``pip``.


## Usage

The **rcc-xcorr** tool takes as input a list of correlations, an array of images and an array of templates. 
The correlation list is a list of pairs, the first one correspond to the `image_id` (the image index within the images array),
the second correspond to a `template_id` (the template index within the templates array).

###Example:
````python
from rcc_xcorr.xcorr import BatchXCorr

import cupy as cp
import multiprocessing as mp


images       :  [numpy 2d-array]
templates    :  [numpy 2d-array]
correlations : [[0 1]
                [0 2] 
                [1 3]
                [1 2]
                [0 4]
                [2 0]]

use_gpu = True
num_gpus = cp.cuda.runtime.getDeviceCount()
num_workers = 4 * num_gpus if use_gpu else mp.cpu_count()

batch_correlations = BatchXCorr.BatchXCorr(images, templates, correlations[:sample_size],
                                           crop_output=(0, 0), use_gpu=use_gpu,
                                           num_gpus=num_gpus, num_workers=num_workers,
                                           group_correlations=False)
print(f'[BATCH_XCORR] {batch_correlations.description()}')
coords, peaks = batch_correlations.execute_batch() 
````

***Note:*** The order in which the **correlations** appear in the array is the same order in which 
the correlation results are returned to the calling program.

The program assumes all given `image_id` and `template_id` are valid indices inside the `images`/`templates` array.

## Benchmarks

The following are benchmarks showcasing the performance of the **rcc-xcorr* tool using different
configurations. The purpose is to illustrate how the input data and allocated computing resources
affect the **rcc-xcorr** performance.

### Benchmarking CPU vs GPU

The plot illustrates the **xcorr-tool** performance using CPU vs GPU and enabling grouping.
![performance using CPU vs GPU](rcc_xcorr/benchmark_xcorr.svg)

***Notes:*** The performance gain by enabling grouping is noticeable for a large number of correlations. 
Also notice that for a small number of correlations (***correlations > 30***) the CPU mode has better performance.

### Benchmarking Multi GPU

The plot illustrates the **xcorr-tool** performance using 1, 2, 3 or 4 GPU(s) devices.

![performance using multiple GPUs](rcc_xcorr/benchmark_xcorr_gpu_scaling.svg)

***Notes:*** The number of workers per gpu is a value dependent on the GPU at hand. The goal is to keep
the GPU always busy overlapping `host-to-device` copy operations using multiple worker processes
each of them streaming data to the GPU device in parallel.

## Options

The following options can be used to control the execution of the **rcc-xcorr** tool

### normalize_input 
***Syntax:*** `[normalize_input=True|False(default)]`

This option would take the mean and divide by the standard deviation of the `image`. 

### crop_output 
***Syntax:*** `[crop_output=(0, 0) (default)]`

Use this option to remove the border `(x_px, y_px)` pixels from the cross-correlation output.

### use_gpu 
***Syntax:*** `[use_gpu=True(default)|False]`

The **rcc-xcorr** tool supports a **CPU-ONLY** mode, which can be used in case the parallel computer system does not
count with a GPU. This also allows to have multiple instances of the **rcc-xcorr** tool running on a
given node. One of them using the GPU resources and a second one constrained only to use the CPU cores.

### group_correlations 
***Syntax:*** `[group_correlations=True|False(default)]`

This optimization can be used, in case the list of `correlations` contains multiple instances of correlations where an `image` is
compared against multiple `templates`.

In this option is enabled the **rcc-xcorr** tool first sort and group the `correlations` having the same `image`.
This optimization avoids duplicate transfer of data between the CPU and the GPU memory increasing the performance.

***NOTE:*** The final output preserves the order in which the `correlations` were originally entered.

### num_workers 
***Syntax:*** `[num_workers=4(default)]`

In case the `use_gpu` option is set to `True` the value used for `num_workers` should match the `num_gpus` value (`default=4`)
The workers are used in a round-robin fashion to dispatch individual `correlation` pairs to the device (GPU). 
In order to keep the GPU(s) working at their full capacity a sufficient amount of workers per GPU must be in place.
The amount of workers that would make GPU work at its full capacity depend on the GPU itself.
A rule of thumb is to use 3 workers per GPU device. 

***NOTE:*** Increasing the number of workers above the number for optimum performance will degrade the performance 
of the device due to context switching from the GPU scheduler.

### num_gpus 
***Syntax:*** `[num_gpus=TOTAL_SYSTEM_GPUS(default)]`

By default, the **rcc-xcorr** tool uses all the devices allocated by the job (all the devices available on the node). 
If the `num_gpus` is passed then the **rcc-xcorr** tool restricts itself to use the indicated number of devices 
at most. In case less devices are available then the value is used as an upper bound.

***NOTE:*** `allocated_devices=min(num_gpus, availabe_devices)`

### override_eps 
***Syntax:*** `[override_eps=True|False(default)]`

This flag is used to indicate the ***rcc-xcorr*** tool that a `custom_eps` value should be used instead.

### custom_eps 
***Syntax:*** `[custom_eps=1e-06(default)]`

This option is used together with the `override_eps` flag to adopt a custom eps value to obtain the mask used to avoid
zero divisions whenever small values are used in the denominator during the cross-correlation output normalization.

## Tests

The correctness of the **rcc-xcorr** tool has been test against data created with 
[emalign](https://github.com/research-center-caesar/emalign). The test scripts are:

### Test Cross Correlation (2D alignment)
Test data consists of 925 correlations used during `emalign` 2D alignment.

### Test Cross Correlation (3D alignment)
Test data consists of 2806 correlations used during `emalign` 3D alignment.
